When they came near the appointed place, say a distance of  about a couple of  agricultural fields ( <i class='calibre2'>khet</i>) where the camel had been brought.  The brothers with the camel thought that the news of  the departure of  Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup>  had spread. As such the brothers were coming, they thought.  Hence, they started to walk faster.  The brothers went ahead and Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup>  fol owed them. On the way, the clothes of  Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup>  got entangled in a thorny bush.  Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup>  then sat down. He started speaking about his situation. He said: “<i class='calibre2'>Ilahi</i>! This slave ( <i class='calibre2'>banda</i>) is not capable of  being a spiritual guide ( <i class='calibre2'>murshid</i>).  It does not suit him to sit in the place of  Imām Mahdi<sup>AS</sup> and perform the duties of  a  <i class='calibre2'>murshid </i> like giving sanctified left-over ( <i class='calibre2'>paskhurda</i>) and distributing   <i class='calibre2'>sawaiyat  </i>(shares of  alms received).”  Then a voice from Allah, Most High, was heard. It said: “O Syed Khundmir<sup>RZ</sup>, you are our well liked ( <i class='calibre2'>maqbool</i>). We have made you capable of  succeeding to the position of  (Hazrat) Syed Muhammad<sup>AS</sup>.  We have given you many Robes of  Honour ( <i class='calibre2'>khal'aten</i>).  We have granted you the meaning of  Qurān.” Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup> reiterated his arguments. The voice again said: “We have a lot of  work to be done by you. Where are you going?”  Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup>  then woke up (from his ecstasy). </p>\n<p class='calibre1'>He called Bandagi Malik Hammad<sup>RZ</sup> and asked him for directions to return to the <i class='calibre2'> dāʼira</i>. Bandagi Malik Hammad<sup>RZ</sup> showed the way. Malik Hammad<sup>RZ</sup> asked Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup>: “I heard your voice, but whose was the other Voice?” Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup> said: “The other Voice was from Allah and Prophet Muhammad<sup>SLM</sup>.” Allah be praised. Such was his humility!  And such were the Robes of  Honour (bestowed on Him). Such humility is not possible without leading a life in perfect obedience to Allah. Bandagi Miyan<sup>RZ</sup> returned to the  <i class='calibre2'>dāʼira, </i> after this. </p>\n<p class='calibre1'>After dawn, he sat down in the wooden tent of  Miyan Khanjeo<sup>RA</sup>. He summoned all those brothers whose family members had gone to the houses of  their relatives outside the  <i class='calibre2'>dāʼira. </i> He rebuked them and </p>\n<p class='calibre1'>said:  “For what purpose should this servant (of  Allah) remain among you?  You have turned your attention towards the worldly people and al owed your family members to go to the houses of their worldly relatives.” He recited the fol owing Qurānic Verses:<a href='#p9'>8</a> <i class='calibre2'> O </i></p>\n<p class='calibre1'> <i class='calibre2'>ye who believe!

In other words, the seekers began to get  <i class='calibre2'>futuh </i>(charity <i class='calibre2'>)</i> in abundance.  Nine hundred of  the thousand opted for the world. </p>\n<p class='calibre1'>The remaining one hundred persons were still on the path of  Allah. </p>\n<p class='calibre1'>Then again Allah commanded the angels to show the  <i class='calibre2'>aakhirat</i>  (the Hereafter), as it was, to the remaining hundred  <i class='calibre2'>saliks. </i> Ninety of  them opted for the Hereafter.  Only ten continued on the path of  Allah. </p>\n<p class='calibre1'>They said, “We do not want this world or the Hereafter. We are the seekers of  Allah.” Allah commanded the angels to inflict troubles on the remaining ten. Prophet Muhammad<sup>SLM</sup> has said, ‘Verily Allah tests <i class='calibre2'>mumins </i>(believers) by inflicting troubles on them, as any of  you tries to test gold by heating it to know its purity.  ‘THE  LOVERS</p>\n<p class='calibre1'>BORROWED  THE  TROUBLES  OF  BOTH  THE  WORLDS,/</p>\n<p class='calibre1'>AND  THEY  NAMED  IT <i class='calibre2'>  ISHQ-BAZI</i>  (AMOUR).'  Eight of  the remaining ten seekers ran away for fear of  the troubles. Thousands of  troubles are inflicted upon the person who claims to be in love of Allah. If  the lover is honest and truthful, he will bear the brunt of  the troubles. But if  he is a liar and not a true lover, he will run away. Only two of  the seekers remained on the path of  Allah.  A divine voice asked, ‘With whose help or guidance have you reached Us?' One of the remaining two said, ‘With the help or guidance of  the  <i class='calibre2'>kamilan</i> (the perfect).' An unknown hand gave him a blow and threw him into the <i class='calibre2'>asfal-as-safilin  </i>(the lowest Hel ). The last  <i class='calibre2'>salik  </i> was addressed by the divine voice.  He said, “I have reached Your door by Your  <i class='calibre2'>inayat</i> (bounty and kindness) and by the  <i class='calibre2'>wastah  </i>(intercession) of  Prophet Muhammad<sup>SLM</sup>.  He reached Allah.  He was the only one seeker who remained on the path of  Allah (to the last) out of  a thousand seekers. </p>",

At that time a <i class='calibre2'>qazi </i> was in a debate with Imām Mahdi<sup>AS</sup>. After the debate was over, Gauhar<sup>RZ</sup> offered to raise an army of 12,000 men with all the arms and ammunition in six months, if permitted. The Imām<sup>AS</sup> asked him how he would do it. Gauhar<sup>RZ</sup> said he had  <i class='calibre2'>iksir </i> in <i class='calibre2'> </i> his possession. The Imām<sup>AS</sup>  asked him to bring it. When  it was brought, the Imām<sup>AS</sup></p>\n<p class='calibre1'>asked him, “What would you do if this  <i class='calibre2'>iksir</i> is spent.” Gauhar<sup>RZ</sup> said, </p>\n<p class='calibre1'>“I can prepare that much  <i class='calibre2'>iksir</i> in one week. The Imām<sup>AS</sup> said, “You had brought your  <i class='calibre2'>buth </i>(idol) with you.” The Imām<sup>AS</sup> ordered, “Drag him and throw him out of the   <i class='calibre2'>dāʼira. </i>”  When he was thrown out, Gauhar<sup>RZ</sup> was lying in the forest adjacent to the  <i class='calibre2'>dāʼira</i> for three days crying and lamenting. Somebody asked him to say his daily prayers under the prevailing circumstances. Gauhar<sup>RZ</sup> said, “I am away from Allah Most High.  Whose prayers  ( <i class='calibre2'>namāz</i>) shall I say?”  This information reached Imām Mahdi<sup>AS</sup>. Imām Mahdi<sup>AS</sup> said, “Throw the <i class='calibre2'>iksir</i> in the well and then bring him here, if he wants to return.” The orders of the Imām<sup>AS</sup> were carried out. The  <i class='calibre2'>iksir</i> was thrown into the wel . While throwing the  <i class='calibre2'>iksir</i> into the wel , some of its particles had fallen on the side ( <i class='calibre2'>kinara</i>) of the wel .  Miyan Syed Salamul ah<sup>RZ</sup> </p>\n<p class='calibre1'>col ected these particles to test (if the  <i class='calibre2'>iksir</i> was genuine). He heated the metal jug lying in his house and applied the  <i class='calibre2'>iksir</i> on that jug. The jug became of pure gold. Later, Miyan Salamul ah<sup>RZ</sup>, ashamed of his act, came to Imām  Mahdi<sup>AS</sup>  and confessed, “O my lord!  I have committed a mistake.”  “What mistake,” asked the Imām<sup>AS</sup>.  (Miyan Salamul ah<sup>RZ</sup>  narrated the episode.) The Imām<sup>AS</sup>  asked him to distribute it (the proceeds of the golden jug) as  <i class='calibre2'>sawaiyat</i>. But he said that Miyan Salamul ah<sup>RZ</sup> should not take his share of the  <i class='calibre2'>sawaiyat. </i> The orders of the Imām<sup>AS</sup> were carried out. </p>",
